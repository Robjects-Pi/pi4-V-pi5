Pi 4 vs. pi 5 - buy or nah?

<!-- add image of both (be used for thumbnail photo) -->
    




Test comparisons

both rpi 4 and rpi 5 tests


Control variables:

- Both are brand new and have never been utilized
- both software that's going to be incorporated is the exact (it's gonna be next where it is way better hopeless holistic representation of the performance across many metrics
The metrics:
1. Testing both the USB 3.0 speed across external drive and a hard drive multiplex into different USB slots
2. A test of the data file synchronization across 10x10 GB Consecutive uploads and
3. synchronization of 300 photos of about average size (3-10 MBS)
4. 100 videos the same files that is split and various sizes depending on duration
5. A test of the temperature using the standard raspberry pi fan the respective power supplies (3 A vs 5 A )


realistically, both these devices are really fast and the smaller and more ever to be years of relevance


After the test, I'm I plan on doing a comparison of the less technical features such as the aesthetics device, the noise of their fan, book of installation to a wall, comparison of costs.

Analysis I can give you my opinion if it is worth the benefits from you release depending on your intended use case


Focus on providing more concrete factual data that can be repeated so that you may reach a more objective decision and give you the data and inspiration to incorporate your groundbreaking ideas and technology on.


For my videos, I plan to keep a more data science approach and will spend more of my time examining how to provide science based reports with the new and constantly changing machine, learning and AI solutions with the real ones no possibilities only through continuous and never ending learnings from failure
