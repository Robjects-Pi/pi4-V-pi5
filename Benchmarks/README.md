To create a link to an image in the "images" folder, you can use the following Markdown syntax:

![Raspberry Pi 4 Technical Specifications Overview](/images/pi-4-specifications.jpeg)

Replace "Image Description" with a brief description of the image, and "image_filename.png" with the actual filename of the image you want to link to. Make sure the image file is located in the "images" folder relative to your README.md file.

Remember to include the file extension (e.g., .png, .jpg) in the image filename.
