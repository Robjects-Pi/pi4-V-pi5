## Quick Instructions for Running Benchmarks

To ensure consistency across all benchmarks, we will use the same scripts for both terminal and file output. Below are the instructions for running each benchmark tool:

### Sysbench

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install sysbench
```

**Single-Threaded CPU Test:**

```bash
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run | tee sysbench_single_thread.txt
```

**Multi-Threaded CPU Test:**

```bash
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --num-threads=4 run | tee sysbench_multi_thread.txt
```

### Stress-ng

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install stress-ng
```

**CPU Stress Test:**

```bash
stress-ng --cpu 4 --cpu-method matrixprod --timeout 300s | tee stress_ng_cpu.txt
```

### PassMark PerformanceTest

**Installation:**

Download the Linux version from the PassMark website and follow the installation instructions.

**Usage:**

```bash
./pt_linux_arm64 -r 3 | tee passmark_performance_test.txt
```

### Vcgencmd

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install stress
```

**Benchmarking Script:**

Create a script named `benchmark.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Benchmark Tool"
output_file="benchmark.csv"
echo "Timestamp,CPU Temperature (Â°C),CPU Clock Speed (MHz),CPU Throttled" > "$output_file"

echo "Idle data for 60 seconds"
for i in {1..60}; do
    timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    cpu_temp=$(vcgencmd measure_temp | cut -d= -f2 | cut -d\' -f1)
    cpu_freq=$(vcgencmd measure_clock arm | cut -d= -f2)
    cpu_throttled=$(vcgencmd get_throttled | cut -d= -f2)
    echo "$timestamp,$cpu_temp,$cpu_freq,$cpu_throttled" >> "$output_file"
    sleep 1
done

stress --cpu 4 -t 300 &
echo "Stress data for 300 seconds"
for i in {1..300}; do
    timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    cpu_temp=$(vcgencmd measure_temp | cut -d= -f2 | cut -d\' -f1)
    cpu_freq=$(vcgencmd measure_clock arm | cut -d= -f2)
    cpu_throttled=$(vcgencmd get_throttled | cut -d= -f2)
    echo "$timestamp,$cpu_temp,$cpu_freq,$cpu_throttled" >> "$output_file"
    sleep 1
done
```

**Run the Script:**

```bash
chmod +x benchmark.sh
./benchmark.sh | tee vcgencmd_benchmark.txt
```
