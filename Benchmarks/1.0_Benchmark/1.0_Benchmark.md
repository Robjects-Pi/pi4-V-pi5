# Raspberry Pi Benchmarking Suite

## Introduction

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Benchmarking Suite! This repository contains tools and instructions for benchmarking the performance of your Raspberry Pi. Whether you are using a Raspberry Pi 4 or the latest Raspberry Pi 5, this guide will help you get started with configuring your device and running comprehensive benchmark tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 5
- A 64-bit distribution of Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm
- An active internet connection
- SSH enabled on your Raspberry Pi

### Configuring Raspberry Pi Connect

Raspberry Pi Connect provides secure access to your Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world. Follow these steps to configure it:

1. **Update Your System**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Raspberry Pi Connect**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install rpi-connect
   ```

3. **Reboot Your Raspberry Pi**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Link Your Raspberry Pi to Your Raspberry Pi ID**

   - **Via the Raspberry Pi Desktop**:
     - Click on the Connect icon in the system tray and choose "Sign in".
     - Follow the instructions to generate a verification URL and link your device.

   - **Via the Command Line**:
     ```bash
     rpi-connect signin
     ```
     - Visit the generated URL to complete the linking process.

5. **Verify Connection**
   - Once linked, the Connect system tray icon will turn blue.
   - You should receive an email notification indicating that a new device has signed into Connect.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Raspberry Pi Connect Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html).

## Running Benchmarks

### Verbose Benchmark Execution

To run benchmarks at a verbose level and view the output via `stdout`, follow these steps:

1. **CPU Benchmark with Sysbench**
   ```bash
   sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run
   ```

2. **Memory Benchmark with Sysbench**
   ```bash
   sysbench --test=memory --memory-block-size=1M --memory-total-size=1G --memory-oper=read run
   ```

3. **Storage Benchmark with HDParm**
   ```bash
   sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/mmcblk0
   ```

4. **Network Benchmark with Speedtest CLI**
   ```bash
   speedtest-cli
   ```

5. **GPU Benchmark with glmark2**
   ```bash
   glmark2
   ```

### Automated Benchmark Scripts

To automate the benchmarking process and log the results, use the following scripts:

#### **Create a Script to Run All Benchmarks**

Create a file named `run_benchmarks.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a logs directory
mkdir -p logs

# CPU Benchmark
echo "Running CPU Benchmark..."
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run | tee logs/cpu_benchmark.log

# Memory Benchmark
echo "Running Memory Benchmark..."
sysbench --test=memory --memory-block-size=1M --memory-total-size=1G --memory-oper=read run | tee logs/memory_benchmark.log

# Storage Benchmark
echo "Running Storage Benchmark..."
sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/mmcblk0 | tee logs/storage_benchmark.log

# Network Benchmark
echo "Running Network Benchmark..."
speedtest-cli | tee logs/network_benchmark.log

# GPU Benchmark (must be run directly on the Pi)
echo "Running GPU Benchmark..."
glmark2 | tee logs/gpu_benchmark.log
```

#### **Make the Script Executable and Run It**

```bash
chmod +x run_benchmarks.sh
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

## Benchmark Results

Detailed benchmark results for Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 can be found in the `results` folder. These results include comparisons across various benchmarks to highlight the performance improvements and differences between the two models.

### Raspberry Pi 4

- **CPU Performance**: The Pi 4 performs well in single-threaded and multi-threaded tests but is outperformed by the Pi 5 in all scenarios.
- **Memory Performance**: Achieves read/write speeds of 4,000 to 6,000 MB/s.
- **Storage Performance**: Shows significant improvements over previous models but lags behind the Pi 5.
- **Network Performance**: Consistent and reliable with good throughput.
- **GPU Performance**: Adequate for basic graphical tasks.

### Raspberry Pi 5

- **CPU Performance**: The Pi 5 shows a 50% improvement in Sysbench tests and up to 80% in Stress-ng tests compared to the Pi 4.
- **Memory Performance**: Achieves impressive speeds of nearly 30,000 MB/s, a fivefold increase over the Pi 4.
- **Storage Performance**: Enhanced with the new RP1 southbridge, offering twice the speed of the Pi 4.
- **Network Performance**: Improved throughput with better I/O capabilities.
- **GPU Performance**: Significantly better, with triple the FPS in graphical benchmarks.

For detailed benchmark scripts and results, please refer to the `benchmarks` and `results` folders respectively.
