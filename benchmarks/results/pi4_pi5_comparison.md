After running the 2 benchmark scripts, the results are stored in the `results` directory. The `Pi4_results` and `Pi5_results` directories contain the benchmark outcomes for Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 models, respectively. The `Comparison` directory includes a comparative analysis between Pi 4 and Pi 5 performance.

Both Rpi4 and Rpi5 directories contain two different raspberry pi models for each version:
1. old_rpi4 and new_rpi4 for Raspberry Pi 4
2. old_rpi5 and new_rpi5 for Raspberry Pi 5
