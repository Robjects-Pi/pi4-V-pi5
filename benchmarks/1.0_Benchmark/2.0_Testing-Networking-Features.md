## Benchmark 1: Testing Networking Features


### Introduction

- **Goals and Objectives**: 
  - Assess the Raspberry Pi's networking capabilities, focusing on wireless performance.
  - Evaluate the system's ability to handle increasing network loads.
  - Compare networking performance between Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5.

- **System Configuration**: 
  - Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 with identical software configurations.
  - Both devices connected to the same wireless network.
  - No other external connections besides power.
  - Latest version of Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) with all updates installed.

### Methodology

- **Process**: 
  - Use iperf3 for network throughput and latency testing.
  - Employ Stress-ng to simulate concurrent network loads.

- **Test Scenarios**:
  1. Baseline network performance (single connection)
  2. Multiple concurrent connections (2, 4, 8, 16 connections)
  3. Network performance under CPU stress

### Results

(Note: The following are placeholder results. Actual testing needs to be conducted to fill in real data.)
