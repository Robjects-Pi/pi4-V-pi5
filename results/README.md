# Raspberry Pi Benchmark Results

## Raspberry Pi 4

- **CPU Performance**: The Pi 4 performs well in single-threaded and multi-threaded tests but is outperformed by the Pi 5 in all scenarios.
- **Memory Performance**: Achieves read/write speeds of 4,000 to 6,000 MB/s.
- **Storage Performance**: Shows significant improvements over previous models but lags behind the Pi 5.
- **Network Performance**: Consistent and reliable with good throughput.
- **GPU Performance**: Adequate for basic graphical tasks.

## Raspberry Pi 5

- **CPU Performance**: The Pi 5 shows a 50% improvement in Sysbench tests and up to 80% in Stress-ng tests compared to the Pi 4[2][4].
- **Memory Performance**: Achieves impressive speeds of nearly 30,000 MB/s, a fivefold increase over the Pi 4[2][4].
- **Storage Performance**: Enhanced with the new RP1 southbridge, offering twice the speed of the Pi 4[4].
- **Network Performance**: Improved throughput with better I/O capabilities.
- **GPU Performance**: Significantly better, with triple the FPS in graphical benchmarks[2].
